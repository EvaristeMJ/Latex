\maketitle
Boolean functions play a crucial role in cryptography and error-correcting codes due to their
diverse applications and rich mathematical properties. One such property, the Walsh 
transform, is a Fourier-Hadamar transform that provides valuable insights into the 
spectral behavior of Boolean functions. The Walsh support of a Boolean functions, defined 
as the set of points where the Walsh transform is nonzero, offers further structural information.
Despite its signifiance, the Walsh support remains relatively underexplored.
